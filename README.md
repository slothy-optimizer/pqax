# pqax: Post-Quantum Cryptography on A-profile Arm CPUs

This repository is a fork of the [pqax](https://gitlab.com/arm-research/security/pqax) repository,
adding further examples from public-key cryptography (both classical and post-quantum).
Along with [pqmx](https://github.com/slothy-optimizer/pqmx) and [SLOTHY](https://github.com/slothy-optimizer/slothy), it
accompanies the paper [Fast and Clean: Auditable high-performance assembly via
constraint-solving](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1303) by Abdulrahman, Becker, Kannwischer and Klein.

It contains implementations of SPHINCS+ described in [Hybrid scalar/vector implementations of Keccak and SPHINCS+ on AArch64](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1243). See [sphincsplus](sphincsplus) for more details.

## Structure

The main components of the repository are the following:
* [`asm`](asm): Core primitives in optimized assembly, auto-generated or handwritten.
* [`tests`](tests): C-based tests for core primitives using a minimal hardware abstraction layer (HAL).
* [`envs`](envs): Test environments implementing the HAL.
* [`sphincsplus`](sphincsplus): Supporting material for the paper "Hybrid scalar/vector implementations of Keccak on
  AArch64"
* [`nelight`](nelight): Submodule for the [SLOTHY superoptimizer](https://github.com/slothy-optimizer/slothy).

The following sections explain each component in greater detail.

### Optimized assembly routines

The heart of the repository are optimized assembly routines for core components of the post quantum primitives under
consideration, such as the NTT or Keccak. All optimized assembly is contained in the [`asm`](asm) directory, which is structured
as follows:

* [`asm/manual`](asm/manual) contains assembly files that have been written by hand, or auto-optimized from such
  through [SLOTHY](https://github.com/slothy-optimizer/slothy).
* [`asm/scripts`](asm/scripts) contains code generation scripts for various
  algorithms around polynomial multiplication or the PQC schemes they're relevant for, as well as other tests and
  examples.
* [`asm/auto/`](asm/auto/) contains the assembly auto-generated by the examples in
  [`asm/scripts`](asm/scripts/). Its structure mirrors that of [`asm/scripts`](asm/scripts/).

### Tests

The core assembly routines are accompanied by C test programs contained in [`tests/`](tests/). For example, the
Keccak implementations from [`asm/manual/keccak_f1600`](asm/manual/keccak_f1600/) are tested in
[`tests/keccak_neon/`](tests/keccak_neon/).
The test files platform-independent and only rely on a small hardware abstraction layer
[`tests/inc/hal.h`](tests/inc/hal.h) which declares stubs for debugging, measuring, and random sources.

### Test environments

As mentioned above, the tests from [`tests/`](tests/) can be run in any environment defining the hardware abstraction layer
interface [`tests/inc/hal.h`](tests/inc/hal.h).

The supported test environments are located in [`envs`](envs/). There are currently two test environments: `native` for
builds on an Arm host, and `cross` for cross-compilation. For the `cross` test environment, you can specific the
environment variable `CYCLES` as one of `NO, PMU, PERF` to indicate the source of cycle counts, and `PLATFORM` as one of
`v8a` or `v84a` to control the compilation target.

## Usage

To build/run tests, use `make build-{cross,native}-{testname}`, where `test` is one of the tests in
[tests](tests). For example, to cross-compile the Keccak tests for simulation in QEMU, use `CYCLES=NO make
build-cross-keccak_neon`.
